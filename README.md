# sgfspider

Playing with [scrapy](http://scrapy.org), crawling the web for SGF Go game files.

Currently ideas only; i.e, incomplete.

Uses Python 2.7 (because of the dependency on scrapy).

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to test:
```
$ nosetests
```

I use [redgreen](https://github.com/vmalloc/redgreen) for continuous testing
```
$ redgreen
```
